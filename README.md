# Data Science Projects

This repository contains various data science projects that I have completed or am working on. The projects cover different topics and use different tools and techniques, such as web scraping, data wrangling, data visualization, machine learning, and dashboard creation. The projects are mainly based on Python and Jupyter notebooks, but some also use SQL and other languages.

## List of Projects

- **Data Science Ecosystem**: This project explores the data science ecosystem and its components, such as data sources, tools, platforms, and applications. It also provides some examples of data science projects and resources for learning more.
- **Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data**: This project uses Python to extract stock data from Yahoo Finance and plot the historical prices and volumes of selected stocks. It also calculates some basic statistics and indicators, such as mean, standard deviation, moving average, and correlation.
- **SpaceX Launch Analysis**: This project consists of several sub-projects that analyze the launch data of SpaceX, a private aerospace company. The sub-projects include:
  - Web scraping: This sub-project scrapes the launch data from the SpaceX website using BeautifulSoup and requests libraries.
  - Data wrangling: This sub-project cleans and transforms the scraped data using Pandas and NumPy libraries.
  - SQL: This sub-project stores the wrangled data in a SQLite database and performs some queries using SQL.
  - Data visualization: This sub-project creates some charts and graphs to visualize the launch data using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
  - Machine learning: This sub-project applies some machine learning techniques to predict the success rate of future launches using scikit-learn library.
  - Dashboard: This sub-project creates an interactive dashboard to display the launch data using Plotly Dash library.
